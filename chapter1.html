    <p class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Wildfire</p>
    <p class="chapter-text">The kingdom of Crestant was a peaceful kingdom. The day of July 18th is no different. 
      Peaceful, and cheerful was the best way to describe it. King Krowa looked upon his city
      his ancestors before him built from the ground up. He gazed upon the centuries it took to 
      unite the Koalas, the decades to grow the foundation that is the great tree, the years 
      to form the friendships and alliances to guarantee his people's safety. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The streets was still full of life as the 18th of July marked the beginnings of this
      empire. The younger Koalas made their way through the streets with joy on their faces,
      eager to try out the highest quality eucalypt leaves - what many would consider a delicacy.
      Even the older Koalas left the safety of their trees for this occasion. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Your majesty are you listening?" said Layla with an annoyed face. "How many times do I have
      to tell you to not call me that? We've know each other since age 5" responded Krowa. "Maybe if
      you listened to me, I'd return the favour" smiled Layla.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Layla was the King's royal assistant. They have known each other since childhood, but as 
      they grew up, the difference in status made Layla respond in much more formal ways than Krowa 
      would have liked. If he was completely honest, he missed her old self. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I'm ordering you to take a day off, and enjoy the holiday with me" said Krowa. "Fine, fine"
      said Layla, rolling her eyes. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      ...
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The festival itself had already begun hours ago, still, it showed no signs of slowing
      down even in the scorching afternoon heat. Krowa and Layla strolled down the streets 
      greeting his people. Krowa blushed as murmurs of a Koala queen could be heard from 
      Koalas too loud for their own good. To his right, Layla strolled along without care.
      Her fur glistened in the summer light, the breeze ruffling her hair ever so slightly.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Krowa and Layla crawled up to one of the festival stalls. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "How yer doing on this fine day yer masjesty, mah names Samuel!" exclaimed the stall 
      owner who seemed to be an older koala, hair already turning into a whiter shade of grey.  
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I'm doing quite alright today, taking a day off of negotiating trade with the Kangaroos."
      replied Krowa. "What are you selling here?"
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I serve ye two the best mushroom sliders with pickled fennel and harissa creme fraiche
      there is in Crestant" said Samuel excitedly.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The old koala turned to begin cooking, at speeds much faster than someone his age
      usually can handle. The smoke he was producing roared into the hot air, distorting the
      view behind it. It was enough to make anyone choke. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Layla gave Krowa a quick nervous glance. Both her parents had died to wildfires set
      off by humans - truely wretched creatures. It made Layla fear fires more than anything.
      Krowa responded by giving her paw a firm squeeze, a little bit of reassurance is usually
      all she needs. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      A little bit of the flame from the fire hit the ground but quickly sizzled out. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Here ye go, one for the king and one for the lady!" shouted Samuel as he laid out
      two plates. The buns were steaming warm, the vegetables snug neatly within. Truly, 
      it did smell amazing thought Krowa.
