    <h2>Chapter 1: The Wildfire</h2>
    <p>The kingdom of Crestant was a peaceful kingdom. The day of July 18th is no different. 
      Peaceful, and cheerful was the best way to describe it. King Krowa looked upon his city
      his ancestors before him built from the ground up. He gazed upon the centuries it took to 
      unite the Koalas, the decades to grow the foundation that is the great tree, the years 
      to form the friendships and alliances to guarantee his people's safety. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets was still full of life as the 18th of July marked the beginnings of this
      empire. The younger Koalas made their way through the streets with joy on their faces,
      eager to try out the highest quality eucalypt leaves - what many would consider a delicacy.
      Even the older Koalas left the safety of their trees for this occasion.

      "Y-your majesty are you listening?" said Layla with an annoyed face. Krowa has always found it 
      cute whenever Layla made that face.
