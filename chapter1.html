    <p class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Wildfire</p>
    <p class="chapter-text">The kingdom of Crestant was a peaceful kingdom. The day of July 18th is no different. 
      Peaceful, and cheerful was the best way to describe it. King Krowa looked upon his city
      his ancestors before him built from the ground up. He gazed upon the centuries it took to 
      unite the Koalas, the decades to grow the foundation that is the great tree, the years 
      to form the friendships and alliances to guarantee his people's safety. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The streets was still full of life as the 18th of July marked the beginnings of this
      empire. The younger Koalas made their way through the streets with joy on their faces,
      eager to try out the highest quality eucalypt leaves - what many would consider a delicacy.
      Even the older Koalas left the safety of their trees for this occasion. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Your majesty are you listening?" said Layla with an annoyed face. "How many times do I have
      to tell you to not call me that? We've know each other since 5 years old" responded Krowa. "Maybe if
      you listened to me, I'd return the favour" smiled Layla.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Layla was the King's royal assistant. They have known each other since childhood, but as 
      they grew up, the difference in status made Layla respond in much more formal ways than Krowa 
      would have liked. If he was completely honest, he missed her old self. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I'm ordering you to take a day off, and enjoy the holiday with me" said Krowa. "Fine, fine"
      said Layla, rolling her eyes. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      ...
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The festival itself had already begun hours ago, still, it showed no signs of slowing
      down even in the scorching afternoon heat. Krowa and Layla strolled down the streets 
      greeting his people. Krowa blushed, as murmurs of a Koala queen could be heard from 
      the bystanders watching. To his right, Layla strolled along without care.
      Her fur glistened in the summer light, the breeze ruffling her hair ever so slightly.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Krowa and Layla crawled up to one of the festival stalls. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "How yer doing on this fine day yer masjesty, mah names Samuel!" exclaimed the stall 
      owner who seemed to be an older koala, hair already turning into a whiter shade of grey.  
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I'm doing quite alright today, taking a day off of negotiating trade with the Kangaroos."
      replied Krowa. "What are you selling here?"
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "I serve ye two the best mushroom sliders with pickled fennel and harissa creme fraiche
      there is in Crestant" said Samuel excitedly.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The old koala turned to begin cooking, at speeds much faster than someone his age
      usually can handle. The smoke he was producing roared into the hot air, distorting the
      view behind it. It was enough to make anyone choke. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Layla gave Krowa a quick nervous glance. Both her parents had died to wildfires set
      off by humans - truely wretched creatures. It made Layla fear fires more than anything.
      Krowa responded by giving her paw a firm squeeze, a little bit of reassurance is usually
      all she needs. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      A little bit of the flame from the fire hit the ground but quickly sizzled out. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Here ye go, one for the king and one for the lady!" shouted Samuel as he laid out
      two plates. The buns were steaming warm, the vegetables snug neatly within. Truly, 
      it did smell amazing thought Krowa.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      As the two took a bite, Krowa noted how he could perfectly taste each ingredient, 
      the mushrooms, the arugula leaves, the parsley, and even a little bit of sourness
      from the lemons of the creme fraiche. They enjoyed the meal as clouds seemed to
      roll over the sky, blocking the sun. The swelling summer heat however, still did not
      fade. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      A chilling scream suddently echoed across the city. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Krowa and Layla gazed in the direction of the scream, in the distance, it wasn't 
      clouds that covered the sun, it was smoke. Following the smoke down to its source,
      Krowa saw light. Not just any light, light from a fire. The type that once burnt 
      through forests upon forests. The type that swallowed all things living in its path.
      The type that killed Layla's parents. The type that could only be created by humans. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The screaming did not stop, one became two, which then became several. Panic flooded
      the streets, as many ran past Krowa and Layla to get a head start on the wildfire. 
      Not many would survive, Krowa knew this. Koalas are slow creatures and this type of 
      fire were set up by Humans to clear out trees so they could build their own communities
      at the cost of all the animals who used to live there.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Run ye two" said Samuel. As the sky darkened, Krowa noticed Samuel's eyes were weary,
      his old age catching up to him. "Leave me be, its far too late for me at this age".
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "No, I can carry you" said the King, remembering all his teachings from his father
      telling him to care about his people with all his heart. "I'm not leaving you
      behind." 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Samuel simply looked away, and sat down in his rusty chair. Starring into the distant
      but rampant fire. "Leave me, save yer selves." Samuel then turned his stove back on. 
      "I've cooked many meals for others in the past, it was truly an honor to cook for the 
      king. But this last meal, will be for meself". That was the last thing Krowa heard from
      the old koala before Layla grabbed his paw and forced him to run. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      ...
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Terror. That was the only way to describe what Krowa saw, what he felt. Around him, 
      hundreds of koalas struggled to run. The smoke completely choking them, no one could 
      breathe. The flames were now right behind them, growing fiercer as it fuels itself
      with the trees and homes of the koalas. He had lost track of Layla within the mob 
      trying to escape. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "MOVE! MOVE!" shouted a koala in knight armor as he pushed Krowa down to his knees.
      
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      "Help! Please!" cried Krowa. The knight did not even bother to glance in Krowa's
      direction, his mind filled only with saving his own life. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The knight's armor was stained by the mud, the symbol of koalas almost fading completely.
      Krowa struggled as he watched the knight pushed through the crowd, trying to make
      his own escape. Not even a dozen steps further, a child was crying, starring into the
      flames, her home probably already swallowed up by the fire. Krowa wanted to help but he
      was exhuasted. Still on his knees, he realized the air near the ground
      was easier to breathe, and so he stayed. He had no more energy left. Burnt trees around
      him came crashing down. He could hear the evil crackle of the fire burning through
      the wood. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      He watched as everything he had known, everything he had built came crashing down
      through the flames. He watched as his mind wondered to where Layla could be at
      this moment. He hoped she would be safe and that she had made it further than he
      had. He closed his eyes. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      ...
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Krowa did not expect to awaken again. When he did, he did not remember much. He realized he 
      was moving, moving at a speed much faster than anything he was used to. Heavy panting came 
      from above. He was being carried by a Human. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The Human seemed to be a child, no older than 14. Her features were covered by dirt and
      ashes, sweat dripping down her face as she struggled to navigate the rough terrain. Krowa
      looked at his surroundings, he was further away from the fire now but the smoke still
      felt choking. The koala kingdom was now in the distance, mountains came into view
      to his left, and a lake to his right. A fairywren landed on a tree nearby as if it were
      taking a break from flying away from the wildfire. Leaves crunched underneath the girl's 
      boots as she ran, the sound oddly satisfying.
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      She was saving him he realized. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      Even at the Human's running speed, she was barely able to outrun the fire. Her pace was
      slowing as exhuastion began to eat away at her. 
    </p>
    <p class="chapter-text">
      The thought then struck him. Layla. He did not know where she was.
    </p>

      Choice A: Struggle and go back in search of Layla <br>
